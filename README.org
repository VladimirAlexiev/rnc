* RNC
The ISO DSSSL group defines a number of XML schema definition languages. Amongst them:
- XSD is the most verbose and unwieldy way for understanding a XML schema
- Then comes RelaxNG XML (RNG).
- RelaxNG Compact (RNC) is the most compact and easy to understand.
  RNC is even easier to read than XMLspy diagrams, because it gives you a ready overview of the schema and convenient search.
  RNC clearly shows deeply nested "matrioshka" style schemas, like the screen shots below.

* RNC Tools
Tools for working with RNC include:
- [[https://github.com/epiasini/XSDtoRNG][XSDtoRNG.xsl]], which converts XSD->RNG. It still does not cover all XSD cases and is in development, but does a decent job.
  - In particular, it converts all ~xsd:include~ to ~rng:include~ without caring whether the included schema is converted or not.
    And since it cannot handle some included schemas (eg OGC Features, which is a complex multi-file schema), you'll get errors about them.
    Comment out such includes.
  - It also can't reliably identify which is the start element. I've added a string param for this,
    but if there are multiple start elements, you'll need to touch the schema manually. See LIDO below.
- [[https://jing-trang.googlecode.com/files/trang-20091111.zip][trang]] ([[http://rawgit.com/relaxng/jing-trang/master/trang/doc/trang-manual.html][manual]]), which converts RNG->RNC and other conversions
- [[https://jing-trang.googlecode.com/files/jing-20091111.zip][jing]] ([[http://rawgit.com/relaxng/jing-trang/master/doc/jing.html][doc]]), which validates RNG and RNC.
  - The binaries are at google code, the source of both trang and jing is moved to https://github.com/relaxng/jing-trang
  - Note: if you get errors like this:
    : Exception in thread "main" java.lang.StackOverflowError
    :  at com.thaiopensource.relaxng.pattern.BinaryPattern.checkRecursion(BinaryPattern.java:16)
    for deeply nested schemas then you need to increase the java stack, eg
    : java -Xss8M -jar c:/prog/jing-20091111/bin/jing.jar -c schema.rnc

jing usage:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
java -cp ... com.thaiopensource.relaxng.util.Driver [opts] RNGFile XMLFile...
  -c     The schema is compact (RNC not RNG)
  -i     Disable checking of ID/IDREF/IDREFS.
  -s     ???
  -t     Prints the time used by Jing
  -f     Checks that the document is feasibly valid (wraps each element in "optional")
  -C catalogFile
  -e encoding
#+END_SRC

I use a batch like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
java -Xss8M -jar c:\prog\jing-20091111\bin\jing.jar -c -i %*
#+END_SRC

** Emacs rnc-mode
In emacs I use [[https://github.com/TreeRex/rnc-mode][rnc-mode]], flymake and jing to do syntax highlighting and "on the fly" syntax checking.
Use a [[https://github.com/TreeRex/rnc-mode/pulls][patched rnc-mode]] to set -Xss for jing as described above. 
I use a setup like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq
  rnc-enable-flymake t
  rnc-jing-jar-file "c:/prog/jing-20091111/bin/jing.jar"
  rnc-jing-java-options "-Xss8M" ; increase stack size to 8M, else get
    ;; Exception in thread "main" java.lang.StackOverflowError
    ;; at com.thaiopensource.relaxng.pattern.BinaryPattern.checkRecursion(BinaryPattern.java:16)
  rnc-enable-imenu t
  rnc-indent-level 2
)
#+END_SRC

Below you see the results of "on the fly" syntax checking at the word "JUNK":

[[./img/RNC-flymake.png]]

I also use Emacs imenu to get a "table of contents" of the schema, and jump to the definition of the symbol at cursor.

[[./img/RNC-imenu.png]]

** Emacs flycheck
~rnc-mode~ uses ~flymake~ to check syntax on the fly.
However, [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/spotlight-flycheck-a-flymake-replacement][flymake has been superseded by flycheck]], because it makes it a lot easier to define checkers and supersedes packages like ~smart-compile~.
See these issues (code already replicated below)
- https://github.com/TreeRex/rnc-mode/issues/9: enable flycheck
- https://github.com/TreeRex/rnc-mode/issues/10: really disable flymake

Install ~flycheck~ with the package manager, then set it up like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; flycheck is a replacement of flymake & smart-compile
;; https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/spotlight-flycheck-a-flymake-replacement

** rncfix
[[./bat/rncfix.pl]] converts ugly RNC annotations, eg:
: a:documentation [
: "\x{a}" ~
: "  \x{a}" ~
: "   See http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace.html and\x{a}" ~
: "   http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml for information about this namespace.\x{a}" ~
: "\x{a}" ~
to nice RNC comments, eg:
: ##   See http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace.html and
: ##   http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml for information about this namespace.
It also does a bunch of other cosmetic fixes that hopefully make the RNC easier to read, eg:
- put trailing ~}+*~ to the line above
- remove superfluous empty lines (commented or not)
- put empty line before definitions (word or comment at beginning of line)

** Scripts
[[./bat/]] includes batch files for Windows (the horror!) that I use under cygwin. 
- [[./bat/xsd2rng.bat]]: XSD->RNC using xsltproc and XSDtoRNG
  : xsd2rng ead
- [[./bat/xsd2rnc.bat]]: XSD->RNC using xsltproc, XSDtoRNG.xsl, trang and rncfix
  : xsd2rnc ead
- [[./bat/rncfix.bat]]: runs rncfix
  : rncfix ead-tmp.rnc > ead.rnc
- [[./bat/rng2rnc.bat]]: RNG->RNC using trang and rncfix
  : rng2rnc ead
- [[./bat/jing.bat]]: runs jing to validate a RNG or RNC
  : jing -c ead.rnc
- [[./bat/trang.bat]]: runs trang to convert RNG->RNC
  : trang ead.rng ead.rnc
- [[./bat/rnc-nocomment.bat]]: removes all comments from RNC, making it more compact and easier to see the structure. But you need to already know what the elements mean
  : rnc-nocomment ead.rnc > ead-nocomment.rnc

They assume all files and trang.jar are put in c:\prog\bin; 
except jing in c:\prog\jing-20091111\bin (has several dependencies):
so you need to modify them for your setup.

* RNC Schemas
I have collected or converted the following RNC schemas related to GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives and museums)

** EAD
- [[rnc/ead.rnc][ead.rnc]]: EAD 2002 version 20080421 (Encoded Archival Description) by Society of American Archivists and Library of Congress, converted to RNC by Vladimir Alexiev.
- [[[rnc/ead-nocomment.rnc][ead-nocomment.rnc]]]: includes 387 elements or attributes
EAD is used widely by archival institutions and projects, including APex (Arvhives Portal Europe) and EHRI (European Holocaust Research Infrastructure).
Uses the following prefixes:
| prefix    | what                    | example                                                                                                        |
|-----------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~e.~      | element definition      | ~e.chronlist~ is element ~chronlist~, which includes various attributes and a sequence of elements ~chronitem~ |
| ~a.~      | attribute definition    | ~a.identifier~ is a simple attribute ~identifier~ that consists of an ~xsd:token~                              |

** EAD3
[[https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3][EAD3]]: upcoming revised version, developed natively in RNG. Schemas listed in increasing recency:
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAA-SDT/EAD-Revision/develop/ead3.rng: the namespace http://ead3.archivists.org/schema/ redirects to this
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAA-SDT/EAD2002toEAD3/develop/ead3.rng
- https://raw.github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD-Revision/master/ead3.rng

** EAC CPF
CPF is a complement to EAD, describing agents that archival materials originate from.
- [[https://github.com/SAA-SDT/eac-cpf-schema/blob/master/cpf.rnc][[rnc/cpf.rnc][cpf.rnc]]]: EAC CPF version 20100301 (Encoded Archival Context: Corporations, People, Families) by Society of American Archivists, converted to RNC by Vladimir Alexiev
- [[[rnc/cpf-nocomment.rnc][cpf-nocomment.rnc]]]: includes 133 elements or attributes

** EAG
EAG is used for describing archival institutions, see [[http://www.apex-project.eu/images/docs/EAG_2012_description.html][description]]. 
- [[[rnc/eag.rnc][eag.rnc]]]: EAG 2012 version 0.1e 20120828 (Encoded Archival Guide), APEx project (www.apex-project.eu), converted to RNC by Vladimir Alexiev.
- [[[rnc/eag-nocomment.rnc][eag-nocomment.rnc]]]: includes 338 elements or attributes
The above is generated from eag_2012.xsd. An alternative official RNC exists, marked as follows:
: # Schema generated from ODD source 2015-03-06T09:33:00Z.
: # Edition: Version 2.7.0. Last updated on
: #	16th September 2014, revision 13036
: # Edition Location: http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P5/Version 2.7.0/
** CDWA
CDWA is used for describing museum objects and works of art, corresponding to the [[http://cco.vrafoundation.org][CCO]] content standard.
- [[[rnc/CDWAlite.rnc][CDWAlite.rnc]]]: CDWA version 1.1 20060712 (Categories for the Description of Works of Art) by ARTstor and J Paul Getty Trust, converted to RNC by Vladimir Alexiev.
- [[[rnc/CDWAlite-nocomment.rnc][CDWAlite-nocomment.rnc]]]: includes 121 elements or attributes
** CONA
CONA (Cultural Object Names Authority) is an aggregation of art object data by the Getty Research Institute.
- [[[rnc/CONA.rnc][CONA.rnc]]]:  Getty Vocabulary CONA Contribution Schema - Release 1.0, 09/28/2010, converted to RNC by Vladimir Alexiev on 22-Jun-2015.
- [[[rnc/CONA-nocomment.rnc][CONA-nocomment.rnc]]]: includes 212 elements

CONA also includes a number of lookup lists that are omitted here.
These include ~cona_associative_type.rnc cona_class.rnc cona_contrib.rnc cona_event.rnc cona_language.rnc cona_lookup_lists.rnc cona_nationality.rnc cona_role.rnc cona_source.rnc~
and look like this (example from ~cona_associative_type.rnc~ i.e. associative relations):
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ar_code =
    "4000/related to"
  | "4001/miscellaneous"
  | "4100/distinguished from"
  ...
  | "4516/was architectural context for"
#+END_EXAMPLE

** LIDO
LIDO is used to describe museum objects and works of art. It's based on CDWA and MuseumDat and is more complex.
- [[[rnc/lido.rnc][lido.rnc]]]: LIDO version 1.0 20101108 (Lightweight Information Describing Objects) by ICOM-CIDOC Working Group Data Harvesting and Interchange, converted to RNC by Vladimir Alexiev
- [[[rnc/lido-nocomment.rnc][lido-nocomment.rnc]]]: 
- [[[rnc/xml.rnc][xml.rnc]]]: defines ~xml:~ attributes ~lang, base, space~. Used by LIDO & EAG.

For LIDO and CDWA I made some manual corrections
- This sets one start element, and introduces the parasitic name "starting_lidoWrap"
  : start |= starting_lidoWrap
  : starting_lidoWrap =
  Corrected to two start elements:
  : start = lido | lidoWrap
- XSDtoRNG currently can't grok the OGC GML schema so I've commented out
  : # rng:include href="http://schemas.opengis.net/gml/3.1.1/base/feature.rng"
  You'll get 3 errors at
  : gmlComplexType = Point*, LineString*, Polygon*
- Moved some comments up, and collapsed simple definitions into one line, eg:
  : administrativeMetadata =
  :   element administrativeMetadata {
  :          ## Definition: Holds the administrative metadata for an object / work record. 
  :          ## How to record: The attribute xml:lang is mandatory ...
  :     administrativeMetadataComplexType}
  becomes
  : ## Definition: Holds the administrative metadata for an object / work record. 
  : ## How to record: The attribute xml:lang is mandatory ...
  : administrativeMetadata = element administrativeMetadata {administrativeMetadataComplexType}

** SPECTRUM
SPECTRUM is a UK museum standard (also used in other countries) that defines museum processes and data (Units of Information)
- [[[rnc/spectrum.rnc][spectrum.rnc]]]: Collections Trust XML Schema for SPECTRUM version 4.0.4 (26 June 2012), converted to RNC by Vladimir Alexiev.
  It uses special documentation properties ~spectrum:unitName, spectrum:description~
- [[[rnc/spectrum-nocomment.rnc][spectrum-nocomment.rnc]]]: 595 elements, of which the majority (490) are about ~Object~ (artwork)

** StratML
The Strategy Markup Language (StratML) enables "A worldwide web of intentions, stakeholders, and results".
- [[rnc/StratML-part1-20140401.rnc][StratML-part1-20140401.rnc]] (ISO 17469) captures the core elements: Vision, Mission, Value, Goal, Objective and Stakeholder
- [[rnc/StratML-part2-20200123.rnc][StratML-part2-20200123.rnc]] (ANSI/AIIM 22) captures Performance Plans and Reports, stakeholder Roles, and Performance Indicators
- [[rnc/StratML-part3-20170815.rnc][StratML-part3-20170815.rnc]] captures additional context like SWOT and PESTLE analysis, RACI, etc
